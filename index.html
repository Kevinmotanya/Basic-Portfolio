                <p>My name is Kevin Motanya. I originally come from Kenya at the coastal city of Mombasa. I live in the city of New Brighton. </p>
                <p>I have a bachelors degree in Information Technology and a certificate in call center operations. I have worked as a computer repair tech, an ISP servce agent and done a little more projects that are IT and non-IT related.Being an all-rounded person is my ultimate goal. My hobbies are traveling, Swimming, photography and embracing various cultures.My family size is five siblings and I am third.
                    <p>I see myself in the future as an IT consultant after getting much experience in this field and interacting with more people. After this boot camp I believe that I will not only learn how to code but how to translate our daily life activities into computer perspectives.
